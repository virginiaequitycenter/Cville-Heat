traverses (.shp, vector shapefile) = data collected by campaign participants 
rasters (.tif, geotiff) = heat surface models

am = morning; af = afternoon; pm = evening
t = temperature; hi = heat index
f = fahrenheit 
e.g. pm_hi_f.tif = evening heat index geotiff raster with fahrenheit values.
